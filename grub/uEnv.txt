# A template uEnv.txt

# This file can be used to provide some initial runtime environment options for
#    the target hardware.

# This file is usually sourced by u-boot during the initial boot process.

# This file is not necessarily required, but may be necessary.

# This file acts as a means of automating the early booting process to limit
#    user intervention.

# Its primary use is to define any required variables to pass to the kernel,
# along with specifying the location of the GRUB binary and what memory address
# to load it into. It then executes that GRUB binary.
